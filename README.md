# Data Factory Tutorials

Welcome to our Data Factory repo where you will find some great resources on how to get started with using Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric!

Here are some useful links as you get started:

- Start by taking a look at the [Data Integration in an Hour tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/DataFactory/tree/main/DI%20in%20an%20Hour) with the overview and prerequisites [here](https://github.com/microsoft/DataFactory/blob/main/DI%20in%20an%20Hour/0%20-%20Overview.md). In this tutorial you will learn how to get started with pipelines and dataflows in Data Factory.
- Then take a look at the [Data Integration and Data Engineering Lab](https://github.com/microsoft/DataFactory/tree/main/DI%20and%20DE%20Lab), where you can learn how to build an end-to-end lakehouse architecture all the way from ingestion to reporting. You will learn how to ingest data into the lakehouse, use notebooks and Spark to transform your data, and then consumer the lakehouse data using SQL and Power BI.
