# Data Engineering: Use T-SQL to create VIEW

You can work with the data in the lakehouse in two modes:

1. Lake mode enables you to add and interact with tables, files, and folders in the Lakehouse.
2. **SQL Endpoint enables you to use SQL to query the tables in the lakehouse and manage its relational data model. It allows you to run Transact-SQL statements to query, filter, aggregate, and otherwise explore data in lakehouse tables.**

Fabric's data warehouse experience allows you to transition from the lake view of the Lakehouse (which supports data engineering and Apache Spark) to the SQL experiences that a traditional data warehouse would provide.

In the data warehouse experience, you'll model data using **tables and views**, **run T-SQL to query data across the data warehouse and Lakehouse**, use **T-SQL to perform DML operations on data inside the data warehouse**, and **serve reporting layers like Power BI**.
